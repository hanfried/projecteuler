[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a collection of hundreds most small mathematical puzzles 
to solve by programming. It is both, a chance to review maths and to improve the own programming skills.

My goal is to improve my abilities in R (that I learn as tool in my way to become a data scientiest). Of course,
I'm a long term programmer, software developer, computer scientist, so I don't have to learn programming from
the basics. Usually, my first intention is to say the computer _what I want, not how_. SQL is a perfect example
following this principle with great success. Of course, the world is not perfect, computers aren't better humans 
(yet), and still very often, I have to tell a program _how_ as either the programming language lacks the ability
to express what I want or even if has, it might not be efficient.

Anyway, here I'm interested how far can I get trying to translate as much 1:1 the problem description into
software. I will often don't use the most efficient way with full intense. Of course, R is even for me as a Perl
specialist a very cryptic language far away of good english, so there's probably a lot to learn for me in terms
of clean coding anyway.

Every problem is in a simple file like 1.R following the convention problem nr.language 
(I might try other languages from time to time to)

Publishing it under github is the contrary,
but we are a free world and nobody has to read in my github project unless he or she wants.
IMHO, software projects should belong to github and discussions should be open and not be hidden 
behind a website portal with login access.
I will also google for alternative solutions as comparing possible solutions is what I intend.
I might change this in future.

I will never add the direct output.
I sometimes will add a discussion section to a problem file.
