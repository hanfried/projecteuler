# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
# By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
  
#  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

# By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
# find the sum of the even-valued terms.

say sum grep {$_ %% 2}, (0, 1, *+* ... * > 4_000_000);


# come on, the definition for fibonacci really rocks:
# my @fib = 0, 1, *+* ... *
# that's awesome
